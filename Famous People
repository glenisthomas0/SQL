#Use JOIN to join together the two tables based on their common factor
SELECT celebrities.fullname, movies.name
FROM celebrities
JOIN movies
ON celebrities.id = movies.person_id;

#Use LEFT JOIN to join the two tables together, and then the CONCAT function to merge data from multiple rows into one field 
SELECT celebrities.fullname, GROUP_CONCAT(movies.name)
FROM celebrities
LEFT JOIN movies
ON celebrities.id = movies.person_id
GROUP BY celebrities.fullname;
