#In this SQL query, I am extracting insights from a database that encompasses multiple tables, aiming to quantify statistical information pertaining to customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.customers 
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iphone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3.Select the customer account numbers for all orders placed in February
SELECT c.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE f.Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
