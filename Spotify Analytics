# For the following project I downloaded a Spotify dataset from Kaggle 
# This file entailed information about the top songs of 2021
# After this I created a table to insert Spotify data into
# Finally, I performed analytics on this dataset using SQL

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify data .csv into a table

# Following this, I analyzed the data using SQL and extracted crucial insights

# First I determined the AVG danceability and AVG popularity by artist and track and I ordered it by the 10 most popular ones
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) DESC;

# Then I determined who the 10 top artists are based on popularity 

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Following this I extracted information to see who had the longest song
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Next, I determined the AVG danceability for the 10 most popular songs
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in this table. Then for every artist with an avg popularity 90 and above, show their name, avg popularity, and label them as a "Top Star"
WITH avg_popularity_table AS (
SELECT AVG(s.popularity) AS avg_popularity, s.artist_name, s.id
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artisti_name, 
avg_popularity, 
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM avg_popularity_table 
WHERE avg_popularity >=90;
